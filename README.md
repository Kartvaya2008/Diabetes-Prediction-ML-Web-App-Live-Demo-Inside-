## 📌 Project Overview
**Diabetes Prediction – Machine Learning Web App** is a complete **end-to-end AI-based healthcare application** designed to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on key medical and lifestyle parameters.

The project demonstrates the **complete Machine Learning lifecycle**, starting from raw data handling to model training, evaluation, and finally **deployment as an interactive AI web application** using **Streamlit**.

This project is aimed at showcasing how **Machine Learning models can be transformed into real-world usable tools**, especially in the **healthcare domain**, where early disease detection plays a critical role in saving lives.

---

## 🎯 Objective of the Project
The primary objective of this project is:
- To apply **supervised Machine Learning** techniques to a real-world healthcare dataset  
- To predict diabetes risk using user-provided medical inputs  
- To deploy the trained ML model as a **user-friendly AI web application**  
- To bridge the gap between **ML theory and real-world deployment**

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection of diabetes can help:
- Prevent severe complications
- Improve quality of life
- Enable timely medical treatment

Manual diagnosis can be time-consuming and inaccessible in rural or resource-limited areas. This project demonstrates how **AI-powered tools** can assist in **early risk assessment** using easily available health metrics.
